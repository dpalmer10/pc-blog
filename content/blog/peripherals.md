With all computers peripherals are needed to utilize the abilities of computers. Without peripherals, computers would just be a giant heavy paperweight.

## Mice

Mice are the most common way people interact with computers, and they are a powerful tool with many different uses. Allowing users to percisely place the cursor and select an area on the screen, the mouse can be used in activities such as web browsing, gaming, selecting a song on Spotify, and so much more. With mice there are 2 form factors, wired and wireless. Wired for a long time was the best way to ensure the lowest latency possible for a more responsive feeling expirience, but as technology as progressed, wireless mice have become just as fast as wired mice, eliminating the need for a cable in most all cases. The downside to wireless mice is that a battery needs to either be recharged or replaced where a wired mouse just needs to be plugged in. Wireless mice allow for more freedom however, and are easier to travel with than wired mice.

## Keyboards

Keyboards are the most powerful way to interact with a computer, if you know how. When computers were first being made, mice didn't exist, and keyboards were the only tool used to navigate through a computer. With keyboards today, there is much customization that can be done. Ranging from Wireless keyboard, mechanical switches, custom keycaps, different form factors, there are many options available. 

## Monitors

Monitors are what display what is happening with your computer. While often overlooked, monitors are an important part of the computer and the expirience. Higher resolutions like 4k (3840x2160) can images looks night and day better with better clarity. Higher resolutions are more resource intensive, and will cause the computer to work harder, but the image quality will be much better. Alongside with resolution, monitor panel types go hand in hand. Panels like OLED will provide amazing colors with deep blacks, but be insanely more expensive than panels such as LCD and VA. Each panel type all have their pros and cons. The 3rd major aspect of monitors is refresh rate. This relate to roughly how many times per second your monitor is refreshing the screen. Higher refresh rate monitors will come across as a more smooth expirience, with things gliding across the screen with fluidity. Lastly, the size of a monitor. Monitors can come in different sizes, such as ultrawide, rectangular, and a square. With each monitor and their resolution, different screen sizes will change your expirience. For instance, 1080p will look good on a 24" monitor, but the image will start to become stretched on larger screens, because the pixel density becomes less, and the pixels on the screen become larger. This is why with larger screens, the higher the resolution is typically speaking. The general size for monitors at 1080p is 24", 1440p (2k) at 27", and then 4k at 32".
* As monitor resolution goes up, GPU utilization will increse, CPU utilization will decrease, and vice versa when resolution goes down
