To make a computer what it is, many physical pieces or components are connected together to make a working computer able to complete tasks.

While a computer may seem complicated and it can be, on the surface PC components are kind of like Legos.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is like the brain of the computer. The CPU consists of cores and threads. Cores are the physical processing part of the CPU, where the more cores a CPU has, the more effective the CPU likely will be at handling large tasks. Threads are virtual instruction sequences for each core. Depending on the task, more cores and threads can be better than a CPU with less cores and threads but generally will be a better cpu the more cores and threads. The 2 major CPU brands are AMD and Intel, with Intel generally being the more common choice of CPU.

## Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)

The GPU is what a computer uses to display images to your monitor or screen by using complex mathamatical equations. The GPU is generally the largest component in a computer, and the most expensive. Sometimes the GPU can be located inside the CPU, called an iGPU or integrated graphics. On an AMD CPU with an iGPU, it is called an Accelerated Processing Unit(APU). The two major GPU brands are AMD and Nvidia, with Intel recently entering into the GPU market. Nvidia is the most common choice for GPUs. 

## Memory (RAM)

Memory inside a computer, often called RAM, is basically super fast, short term storage for your CPU, located right next to the CPU. Programs are loaded into memory so that the CPU is able to access it much quicker and deal with tasks faster. Different memory generations are labeled as DDRx, with the current generation being DDR5. Memory has 2 major main parts, speed and size. The higher the megahertz (MHz) and more gigabytes (GB) a stick of memory has, the better it will be generally speaking. If a computer does not have enough memory or not enough GB, the speed of the computer can be greatly impacted. However, most people in everyday use will be perfectly fine with 16gb and speed will only being a likely issue with older memory, such as DDR3 and lower. 

## Storage

This is the part in your computer that holds all of your data and information. Different storage devices have been used throughout the computer's history, with Hard Drives and Solid State Drives being the most common today.

### Hard Drive (HDD)

Hard Drives are good for cheap, expanse storage. HDDs contain a physical spinning disc inside the metal casing. Due to this, a HDD is susceptible to mechanical error, and is more fragile than a Solid State Drive. HDDs are significantly slower but much cheaper than Solid State Drives, and can be great for storing large amounts of data.

### Solid State Drive (SSD)

Solid State Drives are much faster than HDDs but tend to be more expensive and hold less data. SSDs don't have any physical moving parts inside, and are more durable than a HDD. However, due to the design of an SSD, it has a finite number of read/ writes it is able to do, where as a HDD could hypothecially last longer, in ideal conditions. Out of SSDs, there are 2 major types: SATA and NVME.

#### SATA SSD

A SATA SSD has a physical cable, called a SATA cable, run from the SSD to the Motherboard. SATA SSDs are cheaper than NVME SSDs, but typicalaly slower.

#### NVME SSD

AN NVME SSD is a little device that plugs directly into the motherboard itself, typically with much faster speeds than SATA SSDs. NVME SSDs are newer and more expensive than SATA SSDs, but can be more convienent, since they do not require a physical cable to be routed to it, and it takes up much less space than a SATA SSD or a HDD.

## Power Supply Unit (PSU)

The power supply is what delivers power to each component inside the computer. PSUs have an efficency rating and a wattage that they are designed to handle. Overloading the PSU past its wattage limit may result in the PSU frying, which has a chance to ruin other components. A bad PSU has the most potential for causing the most damage to your PC components.  There are 3 different types PSUs: [Non-modular, semi-modular, and fully modular](./psu-types).

## Motherboard

The motherboard is where all the components connect and communicate with each other. A good motherboard is very important, but can often be a part that people often times spend way too much money on for gimmick features

## Heat Sink (CPU Cooler)
![heatsink](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/61CGQH59UGL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg)

The Heat Sink is what keeps the CPU from overheating. There are 2 main ways to cool a CPU, air and water. Air is a cheaper and less risky method to cool a CPU, but will not have the same cooling as a water cooler in most cases. Water cooling will generally be more effective at cooling a CPU than an air cooler, but with much greater risk. If a water cooler has a failure and begins to leak, that can potentially comprimise your entire system, whereas an air cooler won't if it goes bad. Air coolers will take up more space inside your PC and will make more noise when under load, but are much easier and less complex to install and replace compared to a water cooler. For water cooling, all-in-one (AIO) coolers are the most common type of water cooling, with custom water loops being an option for PC enthusiasts who want the best cooling option, or asthetic. 

## Case

This is what holds all your PC components, and protects everything. 

## Optional Component(s)

* Disc Drive
    * Allows the computer to use a physical disc or CD
