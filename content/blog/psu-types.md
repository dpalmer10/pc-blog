Power supplies are a very important component to any PC. They provide all the other components power to run. However, a power supply comes in many different forms. When selecting a power supply, it is vital to make sure you get a PSU that is capable of supplying your PC with enough power. Failure to do so can lead to a power supply burning itself out, which can be hazardous with fire danger, and releasing toxic chemicals into the air. Websites like [this](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) can be used to help ensure you pick a PSU with enough wattage. With power supplies, there are 3 main types: Non-modular, semi-modular, and fully modular. Alongside with these types, there is also an efficiency rating paired with PSUs, which generally quaralates with a higher quality product the higher the rating.

## Power Supply Types

### Non-modular PSU

Non-modular means that all the cables are attached to the power supply. You cannot add any more cables to the PSU, and you cannot remove excess cables that arent being used. Of the 3 types, non-modular is the cheapest and most basic, but leaves a massive cable mess inside your PC case.

### Semi-modular PSU

Semi-modular PSUs will only have the required cables needed for a pc to function be connected to the PSU. You are then able to connect more cables to the PSU for other things requiring a power cable. This tends to be the more expensive than the non-modular PSU, but cheaper than the fully modular. This will clean up a lot of excess cables in your case and have a much cleaner look, allowing for you to access other components inside your PC much easier.

### Modular PSU

Fully modular PSUs come with no cables attached to it, including the required cables to power a computer. This tends to be the most expensive option of the 3, but it allows for you to customize your PC how you want to. With a modular PSU, you are able to have custom power cables to make the internals of your PC look better to your liking. Modular PSUs also allow for a much easier maintenance. If your PSU were to fail, instead of having to remove all the cables from your pc and replace it all, you are able to simply unplug all the cables from the PSU directly, and swap it out.  

## Power Supply Effeciency

The most common standard for power supply efficiency is 80 PLUS. Companies must send their PSU and have it get tested to recieve an efficiency rating, which can lead to some power supply companies avoiding this who don't want to pay the cost. PSUs without an efficiency rating should raise alarms when purchasing a PSU however, due the danger of a bad power supply, and a higher efficiency rating generally resulting in a higher quality product, but more expensive.

The ratings are as followed: 
* 80 PLUS
* 80 PLUS Bronze
* 80 PlUS Silver
* 80 PLUS Gold
* 80 Plus Platinum
* 80 Plus Titanium
